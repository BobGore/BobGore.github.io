I managed to find a nice tactic in my OTB game in November 21 to finish.
Here white played 29. Nd6 forking my rooks.

I had seen the fork but wasnâ€™t worried. My main concern was that my car
was in a multistorey car park that closed at 10.30 it was now 9:50 and I
thought I didnt have time for an ending I needed to find a finish -so I
stared at the board thinking something must be there and there was.

<div id="htmlwidget-d847674b3e35e9dab4ac" style="width:300px;height:300px;" class="chessboardjs html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-d847674b3e35e9dab4ac">{"x":{"fen":"2r1r1k1/5ppp/8/1N1p4/8/1PP5/2KQN1PP/q7 w - - 0 29"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

## Solution

<div id="spoiler" style="display:none">

29 Nd6? Rxe2 (my opponent resigned here) as 30. Qxe2 Rxc3+ 31. Kd2 Qc1#
or is losing the queen

</div>

<button title="Click to show answer" type="button" onclick="if(document.getElementById(&#39;spoiler&#39;) .style.display==&#39;none&#39;)
              {document.getElementById(&#39;spoiler&#39;) .style.display=&#39;&#39;}
            else{document.getElementById(&#39;spoiler&#39;) .style.display=&#39;none&#39;}">
Show/hide
</button>
