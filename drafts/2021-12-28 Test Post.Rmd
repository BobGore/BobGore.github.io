## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
Chapter1<- game() %>% move('d4','d5','Nc3','Nf6','Bf4','e6','Nb5','Bd6','Nxd6+','cxd6', 'e3', 'Nc6', 'Nf3', 'h6', 'h3', 'O-O','Be2', 'Re8','c3','Qb6')
plot(Chapter1)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
