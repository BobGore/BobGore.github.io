I managed to find a nice tactic in my OTB game in November 21 to finish.
Here white played 29. Nd6 forking my rooks.

I had seen the fork but wasnâ€™t worried. My main concern was that my car
was in a multistorey car park that closed at 10.30 it was now 9:50 and I
thought I didnt have time for an ending I needed to find a finish -so I
stared at the board thinking something must be there and there was.

<button title="Click to show answer" type="button" onclick="if(document.getElementById(&#39;spoiler&#39;) .style.display==&#39;none&#39;)

            else{document.getElementById(&#39;spoiler&#39;) .style.display=&#39;none&#39;}">
